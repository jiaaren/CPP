### Containers
- Templated containers

#### Types
- Lists
- Maps -> dictionaries/hash tables
- Vector - arrays

#### Iterators
- Iterators - stl component of pointers
  - not really like pointers but work the same way
  - all STL classes would use iterators
- can use reverse iterators to do things backwards along with **algorithms**

### Algorithms
- collection of functions/algorithms
